# MLops-with-GCP
Learning to deploy an MLOps End-To-End Machine Learning Pipeline-CICD 

MLops, also known as Machine Learning Operations, is a combination of software engineering and data science practices that aim to apply DevOps principles to Machine Learning workflows. The goal of MLops is to make machine learning models faster, more reliable, and more scalable, so that they can be easily integrated into business processes and applications.

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provides a comprehensive set of tools and services for MLops, making it possible to build, deploy, and manage ML models at scale. In this guide, we will discuss some of the key components of MLops on GCP and how they can be used to streamline your machine learning workflows.

GCP Services for MLops
===

- Google Cloud AI Platform: Google Cloud AI Platform is a managed service that makes it easy to develop, deploy, and manage machine learning models at scale. With Google Cloud AI Platform, you can run your models in the cloud or on-premises, and take advantage of features such as auto-scaling, auto-allocation, and auto-tuning to optimize your models' performance.

- Google Cloud Storage: Google Cloud Storage is a scalable, durable, and highly available object storage system. It can be used to store and access large amounts of data, including training data, model artifacts, and log files.
Google Cloud Dataproc: Google Cloud Dataproc is a fast, easy-to-use, and fully managed cloud service for running Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop workloads. It can be used to process large amounts of data and train machine learning models.

- Google Cloud Dataflow: Google Cloud Dataflow is a fully managed, cloud-native data processing service. It can be used to build and run complex data processing pipelines, including data preparation and feature engineering, as well as training and inference pipelines for machine learning models.

- Google Cloud BigQuery: Google Cloud BigQuery is a fast, scalable, and fully managed data warehousing service. It can be used to store and analyze large amounts of data, and to power data-driven applications and machine learning models.
